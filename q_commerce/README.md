## Shopify API inegration for Quickfired
We have added in the functionality which enables you to add/edit products in a basic way in Statamic which automatically adds those into our Shopify shop using the Shopify REST API
### Login for Statamic
To launch Statamic cd into the q_commerce folder in terminal and type `php artisan serve` to launch the server. To login the username is brad@builtbyfluid.com and password Design11!!
### Retrieving products
To retrieve products we would set up webhooks which would pull the data from the Shopify shop. To save time on this we will do it manually by running the command in terminal `schedule:run`
